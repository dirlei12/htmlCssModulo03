            Because soul doesn't live among things <br>
            but in the bold action of deciphering them, <br>
            I love the sister light that encourages my senses.

            After so many names, <br>
            so much journey towards my own compass, <br>
            I could embrace the sand for centuries. <br>
            Watch the silence pass by and keep on holding it.

            The truth is not in me, every second <br>
            is a fleeting attempt to catch the unattainable. <br>
            The truth is not in anyone, and it lies even further <br>
            from a king than from any beggar. <br>
            If someone is thinking about chasing it <br>
            he should not forget this: <br>
            fire has always been a harbinger of decline <br>
            as intensity the threshold of oblivion.

            When my eyes turn back to the origin, <br>
            I ask one last gift. <br>
            I claim nothing else.

            Put words into my grave. <br>
            The ones I said a thousand times <br>
            and the ones I would have desired to say at least once.

            The ones I used to love, <br>
            the ones I learned along the way, <br>
            the first ones I heard from the lips of my mother.

            Wrap me with them without qualm, <br>
            fear not their weight. <br>
            But indulge the words with you. <br>
            Treat them with respect. <br>
            Put them on my heart.

            Maybe then he whom I told with you <br>
            and for whom with you became his custom, <br>
            would lie beside me tenderly, <br>
            together in the most sacred void, <br>
            when eternity takes our measure, <br>
            when eternity is pronounced with you.
